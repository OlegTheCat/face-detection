**** TODO Feature Storage
Requirements for Feature Storage:
***** Remove row
      Actually this is not strictly necessary. 
      Client can simply invalidate some rows on its side.
***** Get collumn

***** DONE Sqlite based
      Sqlite based solution is not acceptable due to performance
      reasons. It takes ~0.5 min (precise output by 
      time utility 0m31.215s) to create 10x10 storage.
